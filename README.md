# AppMobile-PWA : Retro Shooter

This project was realized by Bourguignon Maxime and Simon Christophe.

## Introduction

For the mobile applications course (AM4L), we had to make a retro shooter. Two choices were possible:

- A native Android App;
- A Progressive Web App.

For challenge and discovery, we opted for the PWA.

## Game

The link to play to our funniest and our most enjoyable retro shooter game: https://retro-shooter-am4l-v2.firebaseapp.com/

### How to play

Tux follow your finger or your mouse (if you play it on a computer).\
To shoot, you must keep your finger (or mouse) down.

After you died, you can save your score and hope to be in the player's top five by setting your trigram on the displayed letters.
